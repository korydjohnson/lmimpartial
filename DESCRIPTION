Description: Fairness aware data mining aims to prevent algorithms from discriminating 
    against protected groups. Enforcing fairness in statistical modeling requires 
    covariates to be separated into sensitive, legitimate, and suspect groups.
    Given such a grouping, we provide estimate which are "impartial" with respect to the
    sensitive covariates. This framework yields a set of impartial estimates that are
    applicable in a wide variety of situations and post-processing tools to correct 
    estimates from arbitrary models by including them as suspect covariates.
    For more information, see Johnson, Foster, and Stine <arXiv:1608.00528>.
